This Dissertation is a research on the theory and applications of the generative design systems as a tool in decision making for defining forms in the construction industry. Adopting an experimental methodology, a set of algorithms was proposed as assisting instruments aimed to design a group of shed trusses inspired by the work of architect João Filgueiras Lima (Lelé). Besides the generation of forms, the system has a structural analysis tool, which was based on Graphical Statics. A working methodology and an approach to architectural design related topics is proposed, and the contributions of this method for the design of building elements are evaluated and discussed.
