abstract = {This paper investigates the support of generative architectural design processes using cellular automata systems with a high level of involvement of human designers. Previous applications of cellular automata to architectural design have oftentimes been characterised by their limited generative capacity for top–down developmental control and for pragmatic rule-breaking as they are easily offered by human designers. This paper explores different options for modifying and extending classical cellular automata systems to support architectural form finding. It discusses the potential of cellular automata as generative design tools with respect to the questions: In which part of a design development, during which periods during a design process and in what roles do cellular automata promise desirable results from a practical standpoint? In response to these questions, a theoretical framework for the integration of cellular automata into the design process is presented. An implementation of a dialogue-based cellular automata-supported design process model is outlined and evaluated by remodelling an existing architectural design project.},

abstract = {The ultimate goal of the described research is a process for mass customizing housing based on computer-aided design and production systems. The current goal is the development of an interactive system for generating solutions on the Web based on a modeling approach called discursive grammar. A discursive grammar consists of a programming grammar and a designing grammar. The programming grammar generates design briefs based on user data; the designing grammar provides the rules for generating designs in a particular style, and a set of heuristics guides the generation of designs towards a solution that matches the design brief. This paper describes the designing grammar using Siza's houses at Malagueira as a case study.},

abstract = {The language of generative architecture inherently focuses on typologies of processes which are non-material. Algorithmic language assumes virtual materiality and relies on computerized images. Generative design processes therefore present unique aesthetics that carry within themselves traces of materiality, which architects such as Oosterhuis, MatSys, ChrisBosse, Morphosis Architects, Zaha Hadid, Biothing, Material Ecology, Gregg Lynn and Evan Douglis explore in the physical world. This research examines aesthetics of Parametric design, Cellular automata, Flocking of birds, Genetic algorithms, and Shape grammars to define framework for evaluating material applicability to generative design processes. In this paper, I put the Aesthetics of Generative Design in a historical context. I define aesthetic implications of algorithmic systems with regard to shape generation and systemize generative design according to essential and accidental aesthetic qualities. Finally, I link Materiality and Performance to aesthetic variations within Generative Design.},

The procedure is simple to implement, sufficiently versatile to incorporate problem-specific constraints, and may also act as a control mechanism to monitor and direct the progress of other optimization routines. The paper explains the tabu-search mechanism, discusses the general procedure with the use of simple examples, and details the important computational considerations that affect the performance of the routine. An electronic-circuit design problem is used as an example of the application of tabu search. Finally, possible modifications to the basic search procedure are indicated, together with lines of further investigation.},

abstract = {In the Korean housing market, mass customization (MC) is an inevitable strategy for ensuring competitiveness. However, though customer needs have varied rapidly under the customer-oriented market conditions, the level of customization for houses has been restricted by economics of scale in the construction processes. With the rise of the level of customization, the cost of site management has increased because of additional labour. Therefore, this paper introduces the finishing information system (FIS), which can be used to minimize the additional commitment of manpower due to higher levels of MC. To illustrate and validate this system, a case study was performed in a real apartment complex project. The results showed that additional manpower for site management was decreased by quicker completion of the job, simplification of the management process, and efficiency of communication.},

@article{Boussuge2014,
abstract = {A construction tree is a set of shape generation processes commonly produced with CAD modelers during a design process of B-Rep objects. However, a construction tree does not bring all the desired properties in many configurations: dimension modifications, idealization processes, etc. Generating a non trivial set of generative processes, possibly forming a construction graph, can significantly improve the adequacy of some of these generative processes to meet user’s application needs. This paper proposes to extract generative processes from a given B-rep shape as a high-level shape description. To evaluate the usefulness of this description, finite element analyses (FEA) and particularly idealizations are the applications selected to evaluate the adequacy of additive generative processes. Non trivial construction trees containing generic extrusion and revolution primitives behave like well established CSG trees. Advantageously, the proposed approach is primitive-based, which ensures that any generative process of the construction graph does preserve the realizability of the corresponding volume. In the context of FEA, connections between idealized primitives of a construction graph can be efficiently performed using their interfaces. Consequently, generative processes of a construction graph become a high-level object structure that can be tailored to idealizations of primitives and robust connections between them.},

abstract = {Construction site layout planning has been recognized as a critical step in construction planning. The basic function of this process is to find the best arrangement of the temporary facilities according to multiple objectives that may conflict with each other and subjected to logical and resource constraints. The formulation of the construction site layout planning problem as an optimization problem turns out to be a nonlinear programming problem where there are conflicting multi-objectives to be achieved. It is shown that the swarm intelligence based meta-heuristic algorithms are quite powerful in obtaining the solution of such hard to solve type of optimization problems. In this study a multi objective artificial bee colony (MOABC) via Levy flights algorithm is proposed to determine the optimum construction site layout. The model is intended to optimize the dynamic layout of unequal-area under two objective functions. The performance of MOABC with Levy flights is demonstrated on a real benchmark construction engineering of construction site layout planning problem and the optimum solution obtained is compared with the one determined by the ant colony algorithm.},

The potential solution to the RCPSP in view of minimizing project duration is represented by the multidimensional particle, where two solution representations, i.e., priority-based representation and permutation-based representation, are respectively considered. The frameworks of the PSOs for the RCPSP according to the two solution representations are developed. Experimental analyses are presented to investigate the performance of the proposed PSO-based methodology, including comparison of the two representations and comparison with other approaches for the RCPSP. The study aims at providing an alternative means for the RCPSP by utilizing the features of PSO, such as particle-updating mechanism that may benefit from the searching experience of one particle itself or the best of all particles in the swarm.},

@article{baumgart2000,
abstract = {Graphical statics is an almost forgotten, intuitive drawing method for solving plane mechanical problems. It was already in use in the 19th century for biomechanical problems. It was still a standard method employed by civil engineers in the 1940s. Superceded by modern analytical methods, graphical statics disappeared almost completely. The method is restricted to plane static problems, but still remains a useful tool for visualizing, understanding and checking the actions of force groups occurring in modern biomechanical problems. After defining the basic mechanical terminology (body, motion, forces), the paper is written mainly as a teaching tool for immediate application. Many illustrative examples (sporting activities, functional forces in joints) help to clarify the difficult biomechanical content. For application, it must be assumed that the bodies investigated behave as rigid bodies under the action of the forces, but this does not prevent application of the method to deformable living bodies if specific static configurations of the bodies are considered. The application of the method requires a good anatomical knowledge and experience with the function of the musculoskeletal apparatus of living bodies. If reliable models are used, the method delivers quantitative results of sufficient accuracy. The paper may also help provide a better understanding of publications containing graphical solutions to bio-static problems.},

abstract = {It is common to start a course on computer programming logic by teaching the algorithm concept from the point of view of natural languages, but in a schematic way. In this sense we note that the students have difficulties in understanding and implementation of the problems proposed by the teacher. The main idea of this paper is to show that the logical reasoning of computer programming students can be efficiently developed by using at the same time Turing Machine, cellular automata (Wolfram rule) and fractals theory via Problem-Based Learning (PBL). The results indicate that this approach is useful, but the teacher needs introducing, in an interdisciplinary context, the simple theory of cellular automata and the fractals before the problem implementation.},

@article{Bollmann2013,
abstract = {Generative Architectural Design permits the automatic (or semiautomatic) generation of architectural objects for a wide range of applications, from archaeological research and reconstruction to digital sketching. In this paper the authors introduce design constraint systems (DCS), their approach to the generation of architectural design with the help of a simple example: The development of the necessary formalisms to generate a family of architectural designs, i.e. simple houses and pagodas. After explaining the formal system the authors introduce an approach for the generation of complex form based on the application of transformations and distortions. Architecture is bound by the constraints of physical reality: Gravitation and the properties of the used materials define the limits in which architectural design is possible. With the recent development of new materials and construction methods however, the ways in which form and physics go together get more complicated. As a result, the shapes of architecture gain more liberty, and more and more complex shapes and structures become possible. While these advances allow for new ways of architectural expression, they also make the design process much more challenging. For this reason new tools are necessary for making this complexity manageable for the architect and enable her to play and experiment with the new possibilities of complex shapes and structures. Design constraint systems can be used as tool for experimentation with complex form. Therefore, the authors dedicate the final part of this paper to a concise delineation of an approach for the generation of complex and irregular shapes and structures. While the examples used are simple, they give an idea of the generality of design constraint systems: By using a two-component approach to the generation of designs (the first component describes the abstract structure of the modelled objects while the second component interprets the structure and generates the actual geometric forms) and allowing the user to adjust both components freely, it can be adapted to all kind of different architectural styles, from historical to contemporary architecture.},

abstract = {This paper deals with refined finite element models based on higher-order displacement fields applied to the mechanical and electrical behavior of laminated composite plate structures with embedded and/or surface bonded piezoelectric actuators and sensors. Simulated annealing, a stochastic global optimization technique is implemented to find the optimal location of piezoelectric actuators in order to maximize its efficiency. The same technique is also used to solve optimization problems of piezolaminated plate structures where the discrete design variables are the ply orientation angles of orthotropic layers. The implemented scheme helps to recover from the premature convergence to a local optimum, without the need of reinitiating the optimal design process, as it is the case of the gradient-based methods with continuous design variables. To show the performance of the proposed optimization methods, two illustrative and simple examples are presented and discussed.},

@article{Stojanovic2013,
abstract = {Most of the existing methods for dam behavior modeling require a persistent set of input parameters. In real-world applications, failures of the measuring equipment can lead to a situation in which a selected model becomes unusable because of the volatility of the independent variables set. This paper presents an adaptive system for dam behavior modeling that is based on a multiple linear regression (MLR) model and is optimized for given conditions using genetic algorithms (GA). Throughout an evolutionary process, the system performs real-time adjustment of regressors in the MLR model according to currently active sensors. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated in a case study of modeling the Bocac dam (at the Vrbas River located in the Republic of Srpska), whereby an MLR model of the dam displacements has been optimized for periods when the sensors were malfunctioning. Results of the analysis have shown that, under real-world circumstances, the proposed methodology outperforms traditional regression approaches.},

By identifying independent states of equilibrium of funicular networks with any topology and fixed plan geometry, a robust and efficient solving algorithm is presented that allows practical limit analysis of (historic) masonry vaults with complex geometry under parallel loading conditions by fitting a provided geometrical target, e.g. the vault's mid surface. The presented framework can be seen as a strong foundation for practical equilibrium analysis of vaulted masonry.},

@article{Granadeiro2013,
abstract = {The envelope shape, the most salient design characteristic in a building, has significant influence on its energy performance. However, in the early design stages, when the envelope shape is defined, energy performance information is normally nonexistent, due to modeling for energy simulation being a time-consuming task, frequently overlooked at this phase. This paper presents a methodology to assist design decisions regarding the building envelope shape considering its implications on energy performance. Basically, this methodology involves a flexible design system, to generate alternative envelope shape designs, with integrated energy simulation, to calculate the energy demand of each design. Shape grammars are particularly suitable to encode architectural design systems, given their ability to encode compositional design principles. Their downside is the complexity in developing computer implementations. This methodology converts a grammar into a parametric design system and is illustrated with an application to the grammar for Frank Lloyd Wright's prairie houses.},

abstract = {The facility layout problem is concerned with finding the optimal facility arrangement in the existing layout. From many artificial intelligence searching methods, the tabu search is widely applied to the optimization problems. In this paper, the efficient strategies of tabu search algorithm have been developed to improve the layout in the facility layout problem. In order to improve the layout results, the strategies in the different intensification and diversification procedures are proposed in this study. The algorithm shows the rapid convergence of searching to solve the facility layout arrangement. A comparison was also presented to demonstrate the efficiency of these strategies of tabu search in optimization. The results show that the proposed multi-searching strategies can effectively improve the search of various constructive heuristics and outperform the existing heuristics for the well-known facility layout problems.},

@article{Maciel2007,
abstract = {This paper studies the influence of architectural education and early experience of the work of a group pf architects, whose work shows strong features of bioclimatic integration (such as Lele and Severiano Porto in Brazil and Spencer de Grey and Mario Cucinella in Europe). The first analysis of their individual experiences, through semi-structured interviews, indicates that the integration of bioclimatic concepts into design is beyond the development or improvement of tools. First of all, it is fundamental that these concepts are part of the design philosophy of the professional, which is determinant on the application of research and innovation in architectural practice. Therefore, before the tools, the formal education can be a tool to promote the inclusion of these principles as part of their design philosophy, influencing the approach to design. It happened in the cases in which there was a commitment of the school to develop a technical knowledge basis in building physics into studio activities, highlighting the aesthetic character of environmental integration. This basis was consolidated in the contact with the building site construction, which also strengthened their ethical commitment regarding the quality of the built object. It has the potential to generate confidence in the consideration of these issues, also making it easier to get the right information from available resources and tools, via a critical understanding of the different issues.},
